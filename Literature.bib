abstract = {We use data on a real, large-scale social network of 27 million individuals interacting daily, together with the day-by-day adoption of a new mobile service product, to inform, build, and analyze data-driven simulations of the effectiveness of seeding (network targeting) strategies under different social conditions. Three main results emerge from our simulations. First, failure to consider homophily creates significant overestimation of the effectiveness of seeding strategies, casting doubt on conclusions drawn by simulation studies that do not model homophily. Second, seeding is constrained by the small fraction of potential influencers that exist in the network. We find that seeding more than 0.2{\%} of the population is wasteful because the gain from their adoption is lower than the gain from their natural adoption (without seeding). Third, seeding is more effective in the presence of greater social influence. Stronger peer influence creates a greater than additive effect when combined with seeding. Our findings call into question some conventional wisdom about these strategies and suggest that their overall effectiveness may be overestimated.},

abstract = {Social media have provided plentiful evidence of their capacity for information diffusion. Fads and rumors, but also social unrest and riots travel fast and affect large fractions of the population participating in online social networks (OSNs). This has spurred much research regarding the mechanisms that underlie social contagion, and also who (if any) can unleash system-wide information dissemination. Access to real data, both regarding topology --the network of friendships-- and dynamics --the actual way in which OSNs users interact--, is crucial to decipher how the former facilitates the latter's success, understood as efficiency in information spreading. With the quantitative analysis that stems from complex network theory, we discuss who (and why) has privileged spreading capabilities when it comes to information diffusion. This is done considering the evolution of an episode of political protest which took place in Spain, spanning one month in 2011.},

This provides new insights into the historical development of the Norwegian Twittersphere, its current network structure and the presence of diverse interests and issues amongst the nearly one million accounts within this community. Its findings also constitute important background information for future Twitter research that takes the familiar hashtag studies route: its observations enable such studies to filter their datasets for confirmed Norwegian accounts only, and to examine the presence of accounts with specific interest profiles, as determined by the present study, in their datasets.},

abstract = {Directed links in social media could represent anything from intimate friendships to common interests, or even a passion for breaking news or celebrity gossip. Such directed links determine the flow of information and hence indicate a user's influence on others—a concept that is crucial in sociology and viral marketing. In this paper, using a large amount of data collected from Twit- ter, we present an in-depth comparison of three mea- sures of influence: indegree, retweets, and mentions. Based on these measures, we investigate the dynam- ics of user influence across topics and time. We make several interesting observations. First, popular users who have high indegree are not necessarily influential in terms of spawning retweets or mentions. Second, most influential users can hold significant influence over a variety of topics. Third, influence is not gained spon- taneously or accidentally, but through concerted effort such as limiting tweets to a single topic. We believe that these findings provide new insights for viral marketing and suggest that topological measures such as indegree alone reveals very little about the influence of a user. Introduction},

We propose a method of network sparsification that preserves a wide range of structural properties. Depending on the analysis goals, the method allows to distinguish between local and global range edges that can be filtered out during the sparsification. First we rank edges by their algebraic distances and then we sample them. We also introduce a multilevel framework for sparsification that can be used to control the sparsification process at various coarse-grained resolutions. Based primarily on the matrix-vector multiplications, our method is easily parallelized for different architectures.},

abstract = {Networks portray a multitude of interactions through which people meet, ideas are spread, and infectious diseases propagate within a society. Identifying the most efficient "spreaders" in a network is an important step to optimize the use of available resources and ensure the more efficient spread of information. Here we show that, in contrast to common belief, the most influential spreaders in a social network do not correspond to the best connected people or to the most central people (high betweenness centrality). Instead, we find: (i) The most efficient spreaders are those located within the core of the network as identified by the k-shell decomposition analysis. (ii) When multiple spreaders are considered simultaneously, the distance between them becomes the crucial parameter that determines the extend of the spreading. Furthermore, we find that-- in the case of infections that do not confer immunity on recovered individuals-- the infection persists in the high k-shell layers of the network under conditions where hubs may not be able to preserve the infection. Our analysis provides a plausible route for an optimal design of efficient dissemination strategies.},

This research proposes a set of conceptual distinctions between four types of populations that emerge when analyzing Twitter data and suggests sampling strategies that facilitate more comprehensive data collection from the Twitter API. Using three applications drawn from large databases of Twitter activity, this research also compares the results from the proposed sampling strategies, which provide defensible representations of the population of activity, to those collected with more frequently used hashtag samples.

The most common strategy appears to be the pairwise comparison of centrality indices via correlation. While correlation between centralities is often read as an inherent property of the indices, we argue that it is confounded by network structure in a systematic way. In fact, correlations may be even more indicative of network structure than of relationships between indices. This has substantial implications for the interpretation of centrality effects as it implies that competing explanations embodied in different indices cannot be separated from each other if the network structure is close to a certain generalization of star graphs.},

abstract = {In a "tipping" model, each node in a social network, representing an individual, adopts a property or behavior if a certain number of his incoming neighbors currently exhibit the same. In viral marketing, a key problem is to select an initial "seed" set from the network such that the entire network adopts any behavior given to the seed. Here we introduce a method for quickly finding seed sets that scales to very large networks. Our approach finds a set of nodes that guarantees spreading to the entire network under the tipping model. After experimentally evaluating 31 real-world networks, we found that our approach often finds seed sets that are several orders of magnitude smaller than the population size and outperform nodal centrality measures in most cases. In addition, our approach scales well - on a Friendster social network consisting of 5.6 million nodes and 28 million edges we found a seed set in under 3.6 hours. Our experiments also indicate that our algorithm provides small seed sets even if high-degree nodes are removed. Lastly, we find that highly clustered local neighborhoods, together with dense network-wide community structures, suppress a trend's ability to spread under the tipping model.},

@article{Staudt2016,
abstract = {We introduce NetworKit, an open-source software package for analyzing the structure of large complex networks. Appropriate algorithmic solutions are required to handle increasingly common large graph data sets containing up to billions of connections. We describe the methodology applied to develop scalable solutions to network analysis problems, including techniques like parallelization, heuristics for computationally expensive problems, efficient data structures, and modular software architecture. Our goal for the software is to package results of our algorithm engineering efforts and put them into the hands of domain experts. NetworKit is implemented as a hybrid combining the kernels written in C++ with a Python frontend, enabling integration into the Python ecosystem of tested tools for data analysis and scientific computing. The package provides a wide range of functionality (including common and novel analytics algorithms and graph generators) and does so via a convenient interface. In an experimental comparison with related software, NetworKit shows the best performance on a range of typical analysis tasks.},

@article{Yang2010,
abstract = {We present results of network analyses of information diffusion on Twitter, via users' ongoing social interactions as denoted by “@username” mentions. Incorporating survival analysis, we constructed a novel model to capture the three major properties of information diffusion: speed, scale, and range. On the whole, we find that some properties of the tweets themselves predict greater information propagation but that properties of the users, the rate with which a user is mentioned historically in particular, are equal or stronger predictors. Implications for end users and system designers are discussed. Introduction},
